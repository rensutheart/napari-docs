# Contributing Documentation

This guide will teach you how to contribute to napari's documentation.

To begin contributing, you will need:

- Some familiarity with [`git`](https://git-scm.com).
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

Choose an approach to contributing:

1. [**Contributing without a local setup**](#contributing-to-the-napari-documentation-without-a-local-setup): This is a simpler approach that allows you
   to make small changes to the documentation without needing to set up a local
   environment. This approach is useful for quick edits or if you are not familiar
   with Git or the command line.
1. [**Contributing with a local setup**](#contributing-to-the-napari-documentation-with-a-local-setup): This is the recommended approach if you are
   making significant changes to the documentation, or if you want to preview your
   changes _before_ submitting them. This approach requires a local setup of the
   napari and docs repositories.

## Ask for guidance

If you'd like to contribute a brand new document to our usage section, it's
worth [opening an issue](https://github.com/napari/docs/issues/new/choose)
on our repository to discuss the content you'd like to see and get some
early feedback from the community. The napari team can also suggest what type of
document would be best suited, and whether there are already existing documents
that could be expanded to include your proposed content.

### Organization of the documentation

The napari documentation is built from multiple sources that are organized into repositories:
1. The main napari documentation is built from sources located at the
[napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs) repository on GitHub.
That repository is where all the narrative documentation (e.g. tutorials, how-to
guides, etc. on napari.org) pull requests should be made.
This narrative napari documentation is written in
[MyST markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
a version of [commonmark](https://spec.commonmark.org/) Markdown
(see a [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))
with some additional features.
2. Some of the documentation about [plugins](plugins-index) resides in
the [napari/npe2](https://github.com/napari/npe2) repository
(e.g. the [contributions reference page](contributions-ref)) and should be modified there.
This is documentation is written with [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/).
3. The [examples gallery](gallery) is generated from Python source files and changes to the gallery should be made to the
[napari/napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) repository (see also
[the guide on adding examples to the gallery](add-examples)).
4. Changes to how [napari.org](https://napari.org/dev) appears site-wide are made to the
[napari-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/napari/napari-sphinx-theme).
5. The [API reference documentation](api) is autogenerated from the napari source code docstrings.
Docstrings are written in the [reStructuredText format](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
and any modifications to them should be submitted to the [napari/napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) repository.
6. Importantly, all of the dependencies for building the documentation are in the [the `pyproject.toml` of napari/napari](https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/main/pyproject.toml) under the optional dependencies `docs` and `gallery`.

### What types of documents can I contribute?

Go to the [`napari/docs`](https://github.com/napari/docs) repo to find examples of documents you might
want to contribute. The paths are listed in parentheses below.

- [**Explanations**](explanations) (in [`napari/docs/guides`](https://github.com/napari/docs/tree/main/docs/guides)):
  in depth content about napari architecture, development choices and some complex features
- [**Tutorials**](tutorials) (in [`napari/docs/tutorials`](https://github.com/napari/docs/tree/main/docs/tutorials)):
  detailed, reproducible step by step guides, usually combining multiple napari features to complete a potentially complex task
- [**How-tos**](how-tos) (in [`napari/docs/howtos`](https://github.com/napari/docs/tree/main/docs/howtos)):
  simple step by step guides demonstrating the use of common features
- [**Getting started**](getting-started) (in [`napari/docs/tutorials/fundamentals`](https://github.com/napari/docs/tree/main/docs/tutorials/fundamentals)):
  these documents are a mix of tutorials and how-tos covering the fundamentals of installing and working with napari for beginners

The [**Examples gallery**](gallery) sources are in the [main `napari/napari` repository](https://github.com/napari/napari/tree/main/examples)
and show code examples of how to use napari.

```{admonition} Plugin documentation
:class: tip

Some of the source files for the [Plugin documentation](plugins-index) are
autogenerated from sources in the [napari/npe2](https://github.com/napari/npe2)
repository. Any edits should be made in the `napari/npe2` repo, and not to the
copy you may have in the `napari/docs` folder. These files' names start with the
`_npe2_` prefix and are located under the `docs/plugins` folder. They will be
generated when the documentation is built and the
[`prep_docs.py`](https://github.com/napari/docs/blob/main/docs/_scripts/prep_docs.py)
script is run. See our
[Makefile](https://github.com/napari/docs/blob/main/Makefile) for more details.
```

```{admonition} Got materials for a workshop?
:class: tip

If you already have teaching materials e.g. recordings, slide decks or Jupyter notebooks
hosted somewhere, you can add links to these on our [napari workshops](workshops) page.
```

### Formats and templates

Our goal is that all tutorials and how-tos are easily downloadable and
executable by our users. This helps ensure that they are reproducible and makes
them easier to maintain. [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a great
option for our documents, because they allow you to easily combine code and well
formatted text in markdown and can be executed automatically. However, their
[raw JSON format](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/content/pairing.html#background)
is not great for version control, so we use [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
documents in our repository and on [napari.org](https://napari.org).

If you are amending existing documentation, you can do so in your preferred text
editor. If you wish to add a new tutorial or a how-to, we recommend you use our
[template](docs-template). Inside the template you'll find handy tips for
taking screenshots of the viewer, hiding code cells, using style guides and what
to include in the required prerequisites section.

To use the template, make a copy of `docs/developers/documentation/docs_template.md`
and rename it to match your content. You can edit the template directly in
Jupyter notebook, or in your preferred text editor.

```{admonition} Already have a notebook?
:class: tip

If you have an existing `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook that you'd like to contribute, you can convert it to MyST markdown and then edit the `.md` file to prepare it for contributing. For the conversion, you can install the [`jupytext` package](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Run `jupytext your-notebook.ipynb --to myst` to create a new MyST version of your file,
`your-notebook.md`. Edit this file to include the relevant sections from the docs template.
```

(contributing-without-local-setup)=
## Contributing to the napari documentation without a local setup

If you would like to see new documentation added to napari or want to see changes to existing documentation, but are not clear on these instructions or don't have the time to write it yourself, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/napari/docs/issues/new/choose).

If you are adding new documentation or modifying existing documentation and would prefer a simpler workflow than the local setup guide described below,
you can use the GitHub web interface to open your pull request
by either [uploading file(s) from your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository),
[creating and editing a new file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)
or [editing an existing file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)
on the [napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs) GitHub repository.
It's best if you first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the [napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs) repository to your own GitHub account, create a [feature branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch), upload/create/edit files through the GitHub web interface, and then [open a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) back to [napari-docs](https://github.com/napari/docs).

When you submit your PR, CI will kick off several jobs, including generation of a preview of 
the documentation. By default, CI will use the `slimfast` build ("make target"), which
doesn't build any content from outside the `docs` repository or run any `docs` notebook cells.
This is great for seeing the copy and formatting. If you want to preview other elements,
you can trigger more complete builds by commenting on the PR with:
```
@napari-bot make <target>
```
where `<target>` can be:
- `html` : a full build, just like napari.org live
- `html-noplot` : a full build, but without the gallery examples from `napari/napari`
- `docs` : only the content from `napari/docs`, with notebook code cells executed
- `slimfast` : the default, only the content from `napari/docs`, without code cell execution
- `slimgallery` : `slimfast`, but also builds the gallery examples from `napari/napari` 

For more information about these targets see the ["building locally"](build_docs_locally) section 
of the documentation, including the part on [specialized builds](building-what-you-need).  

Once the jobs complete you will also be able to [preview the documentation](doc_view_ci) by
using the `Check the rendered docs here!` action at the bottom of your PR, which will go to a 
preview website on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). Alternatively, you can download a zip file 
of [the build artifact](#download-documentation-artifact) and open the html files directly in your browser. For a build triggered by a comment, use
the "Triggered Docs Artifact Build" link.

If needed, a member of the maintenance team will help with updating the [napari.org](https://napari.org/dev) 
table of contents where necessary (by placing a reference to your new file in [docs/_toc.yml](update-toc))
and making sure your documentation has built correctly.

## Contributing to the napari documentation with a local setup

```{attention}
We now recommend using [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh) for local doc builds. It works natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it will automatically clone the main `napari/napari` repository inside its environment. You might still prefer `make` for headless builds, or when adding gallery examples (which requires a full local napari clone). Follow this link for the [advanced `make` instructions](make-advanced).
```

(prerequisites)=
### 0. Prerequisites (using pixi)

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) then clone the documentation repository [napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs) to your machine. To clone the repository, you can follow any of the options in the [GitHub guide to cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) (if you run into issues refer to [the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/troubleshooting-cloning-errors)).
We recommend installing the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli) as it is easy to set up repository access permissions from the GitHub CLI and it comes with additional upside, such as the ability to checkout pull requests.

You can create a local cloned version of the documentation using one of these three options.
   - [Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/napari/docs/fork) and clone using GitHub CLI (recommended):
     ```bash
     # Note you might have called your repo a different name other than "docs" - "napari-docs" is recommended
     gh repo clone <your-username>/docs napari-docs
     cd napari-docs
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/napari/docs.git
     ```
   - Using GitHub CLI to fork and clone with one command:
     ```bash
     # Fork and Clone in one step (but uses default doc name)
     gh repo fork napari/docs --clone --remote
     cd docs
     ```
   - [Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/napari/docs/fork) and clone using Git directly (replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub handle):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docs.git napari-docs
     cd napari-docs
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/napari/docs.git
     ```

````{note}
To reduce confusion and possible conflicts, the `docs` fork is being cloned into
a local repository folder named `napari-docs`. Alternately, you could also
rename the repository when forking `napari/docs` to `napari-docs` and then clone it via `gh repo clone <your-username>/napari-docs`.
````

```{note}
The napari documentation is built using `make` which does not work on paths which contain spaces.
It is important that you clone the `napari/docs` repository to a path that does not contain spaces.
For example, `C:\Users\myusername\Documents\GitHub\napari-docs` is a valid path, but \
`C:\Users\my username\Documents\GitHub\napari-docs` is not.
```

````{dropdown} (Optional) Fork and clone napari/napari for gallery or API docstring edits

```{admonition} Optional: needed only for example/docstring edits
:class: note

Most contributors can skip this. If you want to preview local changes to gallery examples or API docstrings, follow the [advanced make instructions](make-advanced). The `pixi` environment uses an internal fresh clone of `napari/napari` and does not pick up edits from your local fork.
```

If you plan to modify gallery examples or API docstrings, also fork and clone `napari/napari`:
- GitHub CLI:
  ```bash
  gh repo fork napari/napari --clone --remote
  cd napari
  ```
- Or Git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/napari.git
  cd napari
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/napari/napari.git
  ```
````

### 1. Create `pixi` environment
1. [Install `pixi`](https://pixi.sh/dev/installation/) and restart your terminal. Verify with:
   ```bash
   pixi --version
   ```
2. Inside the clone napari/docs directory run the following:
    ```bash
    pixi install
    ```
    ````{dropdown} TIP: Fixing "Failed to download and build napari
    If you get
    ```bash
    unexpected panic during PyPI resolution: Failed to do lookahead resolution: Failed to download and build `napari @ git+https://github.com/napari/napari.git@main`
    ```
    please delete your PyPI cache that. You can see the path to the cache by running `pixi info`.
    ````

(contributing-docs-step-one)=
### 2. Write your documentation

Depending on the type of contribution you are making, you may be able to skip some steps:

* If you are amending an existing document you can skip straight to [4. Preview your document](#4-preview-your-document)
* For all other documentation changes, follow the steps below.

````{admonition} How to check for broken links
:class: tip

If you have modified lots of document links, you can check that they all work by running `make linkcheck-files` in the `napari/docs` folder. However, this can take a long time to run, so if you have only modified links in a single document, you can run:

```bash
make linkcheck-files FILES=path/to/your/document.md
```
````

(update-toc)=
### 3. Update the table of contents (TOC)

If you are adding a new documentation file, add your document to the correct folder based on its content (see the [list above](#organization-of-the-documentation)) and update `docs/_toc.yml`.

If you're adding a document to an existing group, simply add a new `- file:` entry in the appropriate spot. For example, if I wanted to add a `progress_bars.md` how to guide, I would place it in `docs/howtos` and update `_toc.yml` as below:

```yaml
- file: howtos/index
subtrees:
- titlesonly: True
entries:
- file: howtos/layers/index
subtrees:
- titlesonly: True
    entries:
    - file: howtos/layers/image
    - file: howtos/layers/labels
    - file: howtos/layers/points
    - file: howtos/layers/shapes
    - file: howtos/layers/surface
    - file: howtos/layers/tracks
    - file: howtos/layers/vectors
- file: howtos/connecting_events
- file: howtos/napari_imageJ
- file: howtos/docker
- file: howtos/perfmon
- file: howtos/progress_bars # added
```

To create a new subheading, you need a `subtrees` entry. For example, if I wanted to add `geo_tutorial1.md` and `geo_tutorial2.md` to a new `geosciences` subheading in tutorials, I would place my documents in a new folder `docs/tutorials/geosciences`, together with an `index.md` that describes what these tutorials would be about, and then update `_toc.yml` as below:

```yaml
- file: tutorials/index
subtrees:
- entries:
    - file: tutorials/annotation/index
    subtrees:
    - entries:
        - file: tutorials/annotation/annotate_points
    - file: tutorials/processing/index
    subtrees:
    - entries:
        - file: tutorials/processing/dask
    - file: tutorials/segmentation/index
    subtrees:
    - entries:
        - file: tutorials/segmentation/annotate_segmentation
    - file: tutorials/tracking/index
    subtrees:
    - entries:
        - file: tutorials/tracking/cell_tracking
    - file: tutorials/geosciences/index                 # added
    subtrees:                                           # added
    - entries:                                          # added
        - file: tutorials/geosciences/geo_tutorial1     # added
        - file: tutorials/geosciences/geo_tutorial2     # added
```

### 4. Preview your document

If your documentation change includes code, it is important that you ensure the code is working and executable. [Examples](gallery) are automatically executed when the documentation is built and code problems can also be caught when previewing the built documentation.

There are two ways you can build and preview the documentation website as it would appear on [napari.org](https://napari.org):

* [building locally](build_docs_locally) - this requires more setup but will allow you
  to more quickly check if your changes render correctly.
* [view documentation in a GitHub pull request](doc_view_ci) - this requires no
  setup but you will have to push each change as a commit to your pull request and wait
  for the continuous integration workflow to finish building the documentation.

```{tip}
To see the markdown document structure and content change in real-time without building, you can use a MyST markdown preview tool like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [MyST extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight) or [MyST live preview](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-preview.html#). This can also help you to spot any markdown formatting errors that may have occurred. However, this MyST markdown preview will have some differences to the final built html documentation due to autogeneration, so it is still important to build and preview the documentation before submitting your pull request.
```

(build_docs_locally)=
#### 4.1. Building locally (using pixi)

To build the documentation locally, we recommend using [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh), which provides a simple cross-platform approach and automatically clones the [main napari repository](https://github.com/napari/napari) inside its environment.

Once the build is completed, rendered HTML will be placed in `docs/_build/html`. Find `index.html` in this folder and drag it into a browser to preview the website with your new document. 

You can also run this Python one-liner to deploy a quick local server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```shell
$ python3 -m http.server --directory docs/_build/html
```

```{note}
The entire build process pulls together files from multiple sources and can be time consuming, with a full build taking upwards of 20 minutes. Additionally, building the examples gallery, as well as executing notebook cells, will repeatedly launch `napari`, resulting in flashing windows. 

Depending on what you want to contribute, you may never need to run the full build locally. Also see [Building what you need](building-what-you-need) for the `make` variants of the commands below.
```

##### Running a full or partial build (pixi)

- Full build (docs + gallery + notebooks):
  ```bash
  pixi run html
  ```
- Full minus gallery (docs + notebooks, skip gallery):\
This will skip the gallery build but it will still build all of the other content, including the
[UI architecture diagrams](ui-sections), [events reference](events-reference), and
[preferences](napari-preferences), which are generated from sources in the `napari`
repository. This will also run all notebook cells.
  ```bash
  pixi run html-noplot
  ```
- Docs with notebook execution (no external gallery content):
  ```bash
  pixi run docs
  ```
- Fast docs-only (no gallery, no notebook execution):
  ```bash
  pixi run slimfast
  ```

(live-builds)=
````{admonition} Update documentation on file change
:class: tip
Use `-live` variants to auto-build on save with a live browser preview at `http://127.0.0.1`.

For example:

```bash
pixi run html-noplot-live
```

or for quick docs-only iteration:

```bash
pixi run slimfast-live
```
The first run will be a full build of that target; subsequent rebuilds only process changed files.
````

(building-what-you-need)=
##### Building what you need (pixi)

````{dropdown} napari/docs and notebooks (no external gallery)
If you only want to edit materials in the `docs` repository, including notebook code cell outputs (e.g. tutorials), but you don't need any of the sources in `napari/napari` built:

```bash
pixi run docs
```

or live preview:

```bash
pixi run docs-live
```
````

````{dropdown} napari/docs only (fastest)
If you only want to edit copy in the `docs` repository and don't need notebook cell outputs or external content:

```bash
pixi run slimfast
```

or live preview:

```bash
pixi run slimfast-live
```
````

````{dropdown} napari/docs and napari gallery of examples
If you are working on the napari examples and want to build the whole examples gallery (but skip notebook cell execution in docs):

```bash
pixi run slimgallery
```

or live preview:

```bash
pixi run slimgallery-live
```
````

##### Additional utilities (pixi)

To clean generated content (auto-generated `.rst`/`.md` and built HTML):

```bash
pixi run clean
```

To clean files generated for the examples gallery:

```bash
pixi run clean-gallery
```

To generate external sources (UI sections, events reference, preferences) from the napari repository:

```bash
pixi run prep-docs
```
Note: this can take upwards of 10 minutes. In most cases `pixi run prep-stubs` will suffice to generate stub files.

---

(make-advanced)=
:::{dropdown} Advanced: Using `make` for headless builds and gallery examples
If you need to use `make` (e.g., for headless builds, or to add new gallery examples that require a full local napari clone), here's the full reference moved from the main flow.

```{note}
The `make` workflow requires local clones of both `napari/napari` and `napari/docs` (as siblings) and paths without spaces. For example, `C:\\Users\\myusername\\Documents\\GitHub\\napari-docs` is valid, but `C:\\Users\\my username\\Documents\\GitHub\\napari-docs` is not. Running `make` from a path containing spaces can cause destructive behavior.
```

###### Make: running a full build

```bash
make html
```
This matches what is deployed at napari.org and may take 20+ minutes, repeatedly opening napari windows as examples and notebook cells are executed.

If your changes don't involve the examples gallery from `napari/napari/examples`, you can skip the gallery:

```bash
make html-noplot
```

If your folder layout differs, you can point `GALLERY_PATH` to the `examples` folder relative to `docs/`:

```bash
make html GALLERY_PATH=../../napari/examples
```

###### Make: update on file change (live)

Use `-live` variants powered by sphinx-autobuild, e.g.:

```bash
make html-noplot-live
```

For parallel live builds (may crash on some systems):

```bash
make html-live SPHINXOPTS="-j4"
```

###### Make: headless GUI builds

Run full builds without popping up windows.

- X11 + xvfb:
  ```bash
  make docs-xvfb
  ```
- Wayland + xwfb-run (from xwayland-run utilities):
  ```bash
  make docs-xwfb
  ```

###### Make: building what you need

````{dropdown} napari/docs and notebooks
```bash
make docs
```
or
```bash
make docs-live
```
````

````{dropdown} napari/docs only
```bash
make slim
```
or
```bash
make slimfast
```
or
```bash
make slimfast-live
```
````

````{dropdown} napari/docs and napari gallery of examples
```bash
make slimgallery
```
or
```bash
make slimgallery-live
```
````

````{dropdown} Single example from the gallery
For example, to build only `vortex.py`:

```bash
make slimgallery-vortex
```
or
```bash
make slimgallery-live-vortex
```
````

###### Make: utilities

```bash
make clean
make clean-gallery
make prep-docs
```

###### Make on Windows (alternatives)

`make` works natively on Windows (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or your terminal of choice). If you encounter issues, you can consider using Git Bash or WSL as alternatives.

- Git Bash path: install `make` (e.g., Chocolatey `choco install make` or download from ezwinports), use Git Bash as your terminal, activate your Python environment, then run `make` targets from the `napari-docs` folder.
- WSL path: install WSL (e.g., Ubuntu), set up a napari development environment, install `make`, and run `make` targets. For GUI forwarding issues, see notes about VcXsrv and environment variables.

(doc_view_ci)=
#### 3.2. View in GitHub Pull Request

Alternatively, when you submit your pull request, the
[napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs) repository
continuous integration includes a GitHub action that builds the documentation
and saves the artifact for you to preview or download.
Note you will need to [](docs_submit_pull_request) first.
You can then view it in one of two ways:

* preview on your browser via [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) in just one click —
  this is the easiest method but in rare cases it may not match the documentation that
  is actually deployed to [napari.org](https://napari.org).
* download the built documentation artifact and view it locally — this is more
  complicated, but the built docs will always match what is deployed to
  [napari.org](https://napari.org).

When you submit a pull request to the [napari/napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)
repository, its continuous integration will only build the docs in CircleCI. Thus
you will only be able to preview the documentation on CircleCI.

##### Preview on CircleCI

Simply click on **Details** next to the `Check the rendered docs here!` at the bottom
of your pull request:

4. Extract the compressed archive and open the `html/index.html` file on your preferred browser.
   You can also use Python's `http.server` module to open a local server on
   [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```shell
$ cd ~/Downloads/html  # `cd` to the path where you extracted the 'html' artifact
$ python3 -m http.server
```

### 4. Submit your pull request

Once you have written and previewed your document, it's time to open a pull request to [napari's docs repository](https://github.com/napari/docs) and contribute it to our codebase.

If you are simply contributing one file (e.g., a tutorial or how-to page) you
can use the [GitHub web interface to open your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository). Ensure your
document is added to the correct folder based on its content (see the
[list above](#organization-of-the-documentation) for common locations).

To open a pull request via git and the command line, follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).
You can also reach out to us on [zulip](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/212875-general) for assistance!

Not sure where to place your document or update `_toc.yml`? Make a best guess and open the pull request — the napari team will
help you edit your document and find the right spot!

## Building the documentation on Windows

Good news: `pixi` runs natively on Windows (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or your terminal of choice). No Git Bash or WSL is required. Just follow the [local pixi build instructions](build_docs_locally).

If you prefer or need to use `make` (e.g., for headless builds), see the [advanced make instructions](#make-advanced) for complete Git Bash and WSL guidance and Windows-specific notes.

## Adding examples to the [Gallery](gallery)

All of the examples in the [examples Gallery](gallery) are Python scripts that
live under [the `examples` folder of the napari repository](https://github.com/napari/napari/tree/main/examples).
Because of how this gallery is built, every such Python script needs a docstring
containing at least a title (following the `.rst` format of docstrings in
Python) and one or more _tags_. This ensures the example will be shown in the
correct place in the table of contents for the gallery (see, for example, the
[](tagoverview) page.)

Here's an example of what that means. The example file
[add_image.py](https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/main/examples/add_image.py)
contains the following:

```python
"""
Add image
=========

Display one image using the :func:`view_image` API.

.. tags:: visualization-basic
"""

from skimage import data
import napari

# create the viewer with an image
viewer, layer = napari.imshow(data.astronaut(), rgb=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    napari.run()
```

The equals signs under "Add image" mark this as the example title. The text
below is a short description of the example, and the tags are assigned by the
use of the `.. tags::` directive. In this case, the only tag associated with
this example is `visualization-basic`. Multiple tags can be separated with a
comma.

Note that the examples are `.py` source files, and any outputs and images will
be autogenerated when the documentation site is built.

````{note}
If you are running any of these examples in an interactive environment (e.g. a Jupyter notebook or
IPython console), the block

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    napari.run()
```

is not necessary—you can copy-paste the code above it. However, it is required when running examples as scripts, using for example `python add_image.py`.
Because our example gallery is built from Python scripts, you need to ensure this
block is present in all contributed examples.
````

Finally, you can find the current example dependencies in [the `pyproject.toml` of napari/napari](https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/main/pyproject.toml) under the optional dependency `gallery`. If you add an example with a new dependency, be sure to include it here such that your example can be properly tested and built into the documentation.

### Cross-referencing Gallery examples

If you want to generate links to Gallery examples from anywhere in the docs, then the cross-referencing format you use will depend on the format of the doc you are writing. Note that the gallery examples live in `/gallery` despite being in `napari/examples` because [`docs/docs/conf.py`](https://github.com/napari/docs/blob/main/docs/conf.py) specifies that examples are built into the `gallery` directory. The [Sphinx cross-reference namespace](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/advanced.html#know-your-gallery-files) is generated with the `sphx_glr` prefix, then path separators are converted to underscores, for example `/gallery/add_image.py` becomes `_gallery_add_image.py` to get the end result `sphx_glr_gallery_add_image.py`. 

- For `.md` files (myst, used in the majority of docs), use the `{ref}` directive. ``{ref}`sphx_glr_gallery_add_image.py` `` displays as: {ref}`sphx_glr_gallery_add_image.py`
- For `.py` files (rst, used in the example gallery), cross-reference with the `:ref:` directive: `` :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_example.py` ``.
